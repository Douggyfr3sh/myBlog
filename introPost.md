# Hello!  

This is my introductory post.  Basically, my intention with this post is to tell everyone a little about who I am and what I plan to write about.

## My name is Doug.

I'm a Software Engineer currently working full-time on large scale ERP software for the public sector.  On nights and weekends, I spend most of my time studying Cryptoassets and Blockchain Technology.  I also play some poker and spent over a year playing full-time, but recently most of my poker time is turning into crypto/blockchain/software development time.

## Current Projects

I tend to stay very busy, and currently in addition to my day job I'm working on the following:

* An online store and crowdfunding campaign for [Pla Motion Controller](www.plarocks.com)
* Extending a previously written GDAX Dollar Cost Averaging bot with more features
* Learning MeteorJS in order to rapidly develop some web apps in the Crypto space

## Currently Reading

I read articles, tweets, etc. about crypto and blockchain every day, but my two main squeezes right now are:

* [Cryptoassets - Chris Burniske](http://amzn.to/2BTJddY)
* [Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain - Andreas M. Antonopoulos](http://amzn.to/2DXthEU)

## What I plan to Write

Most likely, the majority of my blogs will be on topics in the crypto/blockchain space.  I will probably occasionally write about poker, travel, general software engineering topics, cryptography, and whatever else grabs my interest.
